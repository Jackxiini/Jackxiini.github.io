## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Volgenau School of Engineering[https://volgenau.gmu.edu], George Mason University, advised by Professor Jessica Lin. My research area is machine learning, deep learning and time series analysis. In particular, I am interested in developing efficient and accurate deep learning-based model for time series fully-, semi- and un-supervised learning. My research also includes interdisciplinary applications of time series and exploring time series few shot and zero shot learning.

I received my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Normal University and M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems from Boston University.
