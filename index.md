## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Volgenau School of Engineering](https://volgenau.gmu.edu), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Jessica Lin](https://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/). I also spent a wonderful time as a Machine Learning Intern at Baidu in 2021. I received my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Normal University and M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems from Boston University.

Please email me for the latest resume.

## Research Interests

My research interest lies in the broad area of **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **time series data mining**. In particular, I am interested in developing efficient and accurate deep learning-based models for univariate and multivariate **time series classification**, **clustering**, **forecasting** and **anomaly detection**. My research also includes **interdisciplinary applications** of time series such as astrophysics and healthcare, and interpretable machine learning.

## News

- **[Jun. 2024]** Our paper about time series clustering has been accepted to DMKD.
- **[Jan. 2024]** Our paper has been accepted for an oral presentation at PAKDD'24.
- **[Nov. 2022]** Our paper on time series semi-supervised learning has been accepted to DLG-AAAI'23.
